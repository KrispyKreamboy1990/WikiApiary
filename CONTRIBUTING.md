There are a number of ways to contribute to this project. Before you get started a couple of highlights:

* Much of what makes WikiApiary work is built in the wiki itself. WikiApiary is built using [MediaWiki][mediawiki-org] with the very powerful [Semantic MediaWiki][smw-org] extension (along with dozens of other extensions). Contributing to this project requires a detailed knowledge of MediaWiki templates, Semantic MediaWiki properties and Semantic Forms. Please make sure to familiarize yourself with those.
* The Python code for the WikiApiary bots do all the data collection and data access. The wiki itself never gets data, it just displays it.
* You should join the [WikiApiary mailing list][mailing-list]. If you have questions please send them to the mailing list.

### Report bugs

You may help us by reporting bugs and feature requests via the [issue tracker][issues]. Please be as thorough as possible in your description.

### Improve documentation

You may help us by creating, updating or amending documentation for templates, forms and properties on [WikiApiary][wikiapiary].

### Translation

We are still working on getting translation working but soon hope to allow the interface for WikiApiary to be translated into multiple languages using [translatewiki.net][twn].

### Pull requests

Pull requests to add or fix functionality in the WikiApiary bots are welcome. To get familiary with the codebase please start by reading [the build introduction][build].

It is important that pull requests are associated with defined issues and have good unit tests.
